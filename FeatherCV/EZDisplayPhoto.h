//First, CombinedPhoto is not a 1 to M relationship?
//It is a one to one relationship.
//So I need a object to bind the relationship.
//EZPhoto could do this?
//But the cyclic dependence of the object make me feel bad.
//So I invent a EZDisplayPhoto to capture the relationship.
//There is nothing to sync up to database in this object.
